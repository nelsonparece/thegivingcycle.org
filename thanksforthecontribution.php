			<h1>In Summary...</h1>
			<p class="lead">The middle class has always been the engine that has been the driver of our nation's success.</p>
			<p class="lead">Over the last few generations, as the middle class has grown smaller and weaker, so has our nation's economy, as well as opportunities for each of us.</p>
			<p class="lead">Our nation is faced with multiple problems, many of which seem almost insurmountable, and which have impacted our society, the middle class... all of us ...and You!</p>
			<p class="lead">You wish and pray things will change for the better and You want to help, but You don't know what to do, nor how to start.</p>
			<p class="lead">We believe that the best place You can start is to contribute to our funding campaign here, and thereby begin to help us restore the American Middle Class and the Sovereignty of the Individual in our country!</p>
			<p class="lead">If You agree that the multiple problems faced by our society today have affected You and Your family, join us now, and become part of the SOLUTION.</p>
			<p class="lead">We can help You, and You can help us help our country.</p>
			<p class="lead">Contributing now allows You and us to begin to change all of our circumstances for the better.</p>
			<p class="lead">More than anything else, The Giving Cycle is an opportunity for You to be a part of the solution to help restore and strengthen the American Middle Class.</p>
